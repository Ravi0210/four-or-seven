# four-or-seven

This project is a mini game played in casino's around the globe. The dealer trows two dice and if they both have a total of four or seven they win.
Anything else and the house will win. But this game goes a little further than just a simple dice game it also has a debt system and debt collectors.

The win percentage is 25 percent, so the chance of losing is 75%
